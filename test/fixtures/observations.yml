#    I had to replant the first 12 rows of corn on the east side of treatment 3, rep 4. During planting I must have forgot to turn on the electric motor to run the seed units because this area did not have any corn growing at all. I went in with the same setup as on May 7, 2005 and replanted the area of the first 12 rows on the very far east side of trt 3 rep 4.

#  comment: "(first entry) I spread triple superphosphate (0-46-0), potash (0-0-62), and boron (B) fertilizers to treatment 6 replications 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, & 5. Actual amounts applied on the 15 acres (6 ha) were 3,920 lbs (1,782 kg) of 0-46-0, 5,990 lbs (2,723 kg) of 0-0-62, and 50 lbs (22.7 kg) of boron. The fertilizers were blended together and applied at the same time. The fertilizer was applied with a JD 7400 tractor, C3 1700 rpm, around 6-7 mph, and a Willmar 6 ton pull type spinner spreader. With a spinner spreader it would have been difficult to spread, in one pass, the entire amount of fertilizer recommended. The pattern of the fertilizer coming out of the spreader may not be a uniform pattern at such a high rate of fertilizer per acre therefore; I split the application rate in half then drove over the plots twice. The driving intervals were based on a 40 ft spreading pattern. The second time over the plots I drove between the first set of driving intervals. After spreading fertilizer on all six replications I had some fertilizer remaining in the spreader (about 1,992 lbs) so I applied the remaining fertilizer onto replications 1, 2, and 5, i.e. I did not change the setting on the fertilizer spreader and I went over reps 1, 2, and 5 for a third time. Replications 1, 2, and 5 had the lowest amount of P and K in the soil, i.e. the highest fertilizer recommendations was for reps 1, 2, and 5. Actual amounts applied to replications 1, 2, and 5 (7.5 acres, 3 ha) was 2,352 lbs (1,069 kg) of 0-46-0, 3,594 lbs (1,634 kg) of 0-0-62, and 30 lbs (13.64 kg) of boron. In replications 1, 2, and 5 the 314 lbs/A of 0-46-0 provided 144 lbs/A (161.7 kg/ha) of P2O5. The 479 lbs/A of 0-0-62 provided 297 lbs/A (333 kg/ha) of K2O. The 30 lbs of boron provided 4 lbs/A (4.5 kg/ha) of boron. Actual amounts applied to replications 3, 4, and 6 (7.5 acres, 3 ha) was 1,568 lbs (713 kg) of 0-46-0, 2,396 lbs (1,089 kg) of 0-0-62, and 20 lbs (9 kg) of boron. In replications 3, 4, and 6 the 209 lbs/A of 0-46-0 provided 96 lbs/A (107.8 kg/ha) of P2O5. The 319 lbs/A of 0-0-62 provided 198 lbs/A (222 kg/ha) of K2O. The 20 lbs of boron provided 2.6 lbs/A (2.99 kg/ha) of boron. "

#  comment: "Planted red clover at 15 lbs/A on September 20, 2005 into treatments 3, 6, and 17 in the biodiversity study. We replanted the clover because the clover that we frost seeded on March 16, 2005 did not grow much over the spring and summer. If we want to have a clover crop to plow under next spring I decided that replanting was necessary. The plots that red clover were planted in were treatment 3, plots 111, 203, 306, 403, treatment 6, plots 107, 207, 317, 406, and treatment 17, plots 116, 211, 302, 417. Clover was planted with the JD 7400 tractor and JD 750 no-till drill. Clover was planted 0.5 inch deep. To plant 15 lbs/A of clover the front seeder box on the JD 750 drill was set on 5.5. "

#  comment: (second entry) I spread triple superphosphate (0-46-0), potash (0-0-62), and boron (B) fertilizers to treatment 6 replications 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, & 5. Actual amounts applied on the 15 acres (6 ha) were 3,920 lbs (1,782 kg) of 0-46-0, 5,990 lbs (2,723 kg) of 0-0-62, and 50 lbs (22.7 kg) of boron. The fertilizers were blended together and applied at the same time. The fertilizer was applied with a JD 7400 tractor, C3 1700 rpm, around 6-7 mph, and a Willmar 6 ton pull type spinner spreader. With a spinner spreader it would have been difficult to spread, in one pass, the entire amount of fertilizer recommended. The pattern of the fertilizer coming out of the spreader may not be a uniform pattern at such a high rate of fertilizer per acre therefore; I split the application rate in half then drove over the plots twice. The driving intervals were based on a 40 ft spreading pattern. The second time over the plots I drove between the first set of driving intervals. After spreading fertilizer on all six replications I had some fertilizer remaining in the spreader (about 1,992 lbs) so I applied the remaining fertilizer onto replications 1, 2, and 5, i.e. I did not change the setting on the fertilizer spreader and I went over reps 1, 2, and 5 for a third time. Replications 1, 2, and 5 had the lowest amount of P and K in the soil, i.e. the highest fertilizer recommendations was for reps 1, 2, and 5. Actual amounts applied to replications 1, 2, and 5 (7.5 acres, 3 ha) was 2,352 lbs (1,069 kg) of 0-46-0, 3,594 lbs (1,634 kg) of 0-0-62, and 30 lbs (13.64 kg) of boron. In replications 1, 2, and 5 the 314 lbs/A of 0-46-0 provided 144 lbs/A (161.7 kg/ha) of P2O5. The 479 lbs/A of 0-0-62 provided 297 lbs/A (333 kg/ha) of K2O. The 30 lbs of boron provided 4 lbs/A (4.5 kg/ha) of boron. Actual amounts applied to replications 3, 4, and 6 (7.5 acres, 3 ha) was 1,568 lbs (713 kg) of 0-46-0, 2,396 lbs (1,089 kg) of 0-0-62, and 20 lbs (9 kg) of boron. In replications 3, 4, and 6 the 209 lbs/A of 0-46-0 provided 96 lbs/A (107.8 kg/ha) of P2O5. The 319 lbs/A of 0-0-62 provided 198 lbs/A (222 kg/ha) of K2O. The 20 lbs of boron provided 2.6 lbs/A (2.99 kg/ha) of boron.

#    Applied 28% nitrogen solution (28-0-0) at 16 gals/acre (150L/ha) to all replications of treatment 3 on the LTER main site winter wheat, (reps 6, 1, 3, 2, 4, & 5). Average height of the wheat was 2-3 inches. Total amount of fertilizer applied was 239 gals on 14.82 acres (6 hectares). One gallon of 28% fertilizer weighs 10.67 lbs. 48.18 lbs N/A (54.09 kg N/ha) was applied. The goal was to apply the nitrogen fertilizer at 3/5 (0.60) rate of the total amount applied to treatments 1 and 2. The protocol was to apply a total amount of 80 lbs N/A for treatments 1 and 2. We applied 32 lbs N/A in the autumn of 2003 so we were trying to apply another 48 lbs N/A in the spring of 2004 on treatments 1 and 2. The 3/5 rate of nitrogen applied to treatment 3 was based on the total annual amount, spring and fall amounts, of nitrogen, not just 3/5 of the nitrogen applied in the spring. Therefore, treatment 3 needed to receive to same amount of nitrogen in the spring as treatments 1 and 2 received, 80 lbs N/A * 0.60 = 48 lbs N/A. Treatment 3 did not receive any nitrogen in 2003. Weather Conditions: Mostly sunny with air temperature ranging from 77-79 degrees F. Relative Humidity was ranging from 30-37%. Wind was out of the west-southwest at 0-8 mph's averaging 3 mph's. Time of application was between 4:00 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. Equipment Used: JD 5220 tractor traveling 5.0-6.0 mph (gear C1, 1600-1800 rpm's) with a pull type Top Air sprayer equipped with a hydraulic centrifugal sprayer pump and a Raven 440 automatic carrier control unit.

Soil temperature at planting was 60 degrees F. Previous crop in 2003: corn. Lorsban 15G (chlorpyrifos) insecticide was applied at 8 oz/1,000 foot of row (8.7 lbs/A or 9.77 kg/ha). The six border rows on each side of both studies and plot area for both studies were planted with 35Y55. However, as part of an insect resistance management plan the area between the irrigated and non-irrigated studies was planted to Pioneer 35Y54 corn variety. 35Y54 is a non Bt variety. A total of twelve rows were planted to 35Y54. Lorsban was applied to the entire study area and the twelve rows between studies. The first six border rows on the west side of the non-irrigated study did not have any Lorsban applied to them. Leaving six rows without the Lorsban provides an area to set up the corn planter and check planting depth without the insecticide being present."

#  comment: "Sprayed the European Corn Borer (ECB), in the LTER, preemergence to control annual grass and broadleaves weeds.Dual II Magnum (s-metolachlor (+ safener)) was applied at 1.33 pts/A (1.56 L/ha) and Atrazine 4L was applied at 1 lbs/A (1.56 L/ha). A total of 1 qt of Dual II Magnum and 1.5 qts of Atrazine were applied on the ECB study area. Weather Conditions: Sunny with air temperature 68 degrees F. Wind was out of the southwest at 0-5 mph averaging 2 mph. Time of application was 3:00 p.m. Equipment Used: JD 5220 tractor traveling 5.0 mph (gear C1, 1600 rpm's) with a pull type Top Air sprayer equipped with a hydraulic centrifugal sprayer pump and a Raven 440 automatic carrier control unit. Turbo TeeJet 11003 nozzles were used, spaced 15 inches apart with a total boom length of 30 feet. 30 psi was used. Water applied at 20 gals/A, (187L/ha), was used as the carrier. Purpose of Application: Control of annual broadleaves and grass weeds. Sprayed preemergence. "

#  comment: In the Biodiversity Study all replications of treatments B3, B6, and B17 were frost seeded with medium red clover at 12 lbs/Acre, into winter wheat, using a Gandy Air Seeder. Description of treatments are B3 (One annual crop with two cover crops. Three year crop rotation of corn, soybeans, and winter wheat.), B6 (One annual crop with one cover crop. Three year crop rotation of corn, soybeans, and winter wheat), and B17 (One annual crop with one cover crop. Monoculture cropping system {no crop rotation}).

#  comment: "Sprayed the Nitrogen Rate Studies (N-rate), both the irrigated and non-irrigated studies. Roundup Weathermax (glyphosate) was applied at 16 oz/A (1.17 L/ha), and AMS was applied at 17 lbs/100 gals of water. A total of 80 oz of Roundup, and 17 lbs of AMS was applied on the N-rate study area. Weather Conditions: Sunny with air temperature was 74 degrees F. Wind was out of the northeast at 0-8 mph averaging 3 mph. Time of application was between 5:15 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. Equipment Used: JD 5220 tractor traveling 4.5-5.0 mph (gear C1) with a pull type Top Air sprayer equipped with a hydraulic centrifugal sprayer pump and a Raven 440 automatic carrier control unit. Turbo TeeJet 11003 nozzles were used, spaced 15 inches apart with a total boom length of 30 feet. 30 psi was used. Water applied at 20 gals/A, (187L/ha), was used as the carrier. Purpose of Application: Control of volunteer corn (non-roundup ready corn). Sprayed postemergence. Srayed Roundup on both N-rate studies. Because we replanted both of these studies the volunteer corn from the first planting time needed to be reovmed."

#    Because of a hard soil crust that formed from the lack of rainfall we know that we will have low corn population stands in treatments 1, 2, 3, & 4. It was decided that we will not replant any treatmnts within the LTER main site.

If the plots had a cover crop growing (clover that was frost seeded) the mower was set to cut just the weeds that were growing above the cover crop. On average I would say that 1-2 inches of the clover was cut off during the mowing "

We started burning at 10:30 a.m. and finished at 2:30 p.m. This was just burning time, does not include setup and cleanup. All plots burned ok to great. Visual rating of 85-95% of each plot burned; except for rep 6 only had 70-80% of the plot burn. At 10:30 a.m. weather conditions were 42 degrees F with 68% humidity winds out of the north-northwest at 5-15 mph averaging 12 mph. Weather conditions at 2:30 p.m. were 51 degrees F with 47% humidity winds out of the northwest at 5-18 mph averaging 10 mph. The tilled micro-plot area on the north end of all the plots burned great. The micro-plots had lots of thick grass residue, foxtail, from the 2003 growing season which provided great fuel for the fire. "

#    Frost seeded medium red clover at 12 lbs/acre (13.47 kg/ha) into winter wheat in the biodiversity study treatment's B4 & B7, all replications, plot numbers B4: 104, 220, 307, & 404, B7: 105, 219, 305,& 407. Clover was seeded with a John Deere 5220 traveling at 5 mph, gear C1 at 1600 rpm's, and a Gandy Air Seeder. Gandy motor setting was 2.0 and gates were in the middle position. The boom height on the air seeder was 24 inches from the ground. The clover seed was pre-inoculated with Rhizobium Inoculum. Rhizobium is a nitrogen fixing bacteria.

#    No-till planted oats at 2 bu/A (64 lbs/A) (71.85 kg/ha) in the biodiversity study treatment's B3, B5, and B16, all replications, plot numbers B3: 111, 203, & 306, and 403, B5: 114, 217, 312, & 405, B16: 101, 210, 308, & 416. Oats were not treated or certified they were cleaned ben run oats. Oats were planted 1 inch deep. Oats were planted with a JD 6400 tractor and JD 750 grain drill (no-till drill). I would have liked to plant the oats at 2.5 bu/A, but I did not have enough seed so I only planted at the 2 bu/A rate. Planting oats is not a normal part of the biodiversity protocol however, because of wet weather after the 2003 harvest c. rye was not planted so it was decided that oats would be the best option to replace the c. rye cover crop treatment.

#  comment: Dan counted main site stand counts today in treatments 1-4, all replications. Dan counted the number of corn plants in 8.7 ft. The number of plants found in 8.7 ft was multiplied by 2 so that the finial number would represent the number of plants in 17.4 ft. The number of plants in 17.4 ft was multiplied by 1,000. The reason that we used 17.4 feet and multiplied by 1,000 is because one corn row that is 2.5 ft wide would need to be 17,424 ft long to make one liner acre. The average number of plants per acre in treatment 1 was 29,900. The average number of plants per acre in treatment 2 was 32,700. The average number of plants per acre in treatment 3 was 30,300. The average number of plants per acre in treatment 4 was 24,900.

#  comment: At harvest each plot was split into two distinct sides, the west side and the east side. For 2005 the west side of each plot contained a headland pass across the entire width of the plot and 60 rows of corn located on the west side of each plot. The created headland was one pass across the headland with the JD 6 row corn head (15 feet wide). The reason that we need to create an artificial headland was because we needed more room to turn around the combine. Grain yield and moisture from treatments 1-4 across all six replications were recorded. However, the standard agronomic yields recorded on the web page, for the year 2005, were taken only from the east side of the plots. The decision to post the yield from only the east side of the plots stems from the fact that on the west side of the plot contains a micro plot area. In northwest corner of treatments 1 and 2 are the micro plots that did not receive any weed control, cultivation or herbicides. Because of the competition from the weed in the micro plots the decision was made to record the official yields from the east side of the plots. The micro plot area measures 50 ft (15 meters) from the north edge of the plots towards to south and 133.3 ft (40 meters) from the west edge of the plots towards the east. The micro plot area in treatments 1 and 2 that did not receive any weed control was mowed down before harvest.

We started burning at 1 p.m. and finished at 6:30 p.m. This was just burning time, does not include setup and cleanup. The plots did not burn well. Visual rating of 30% of each plot burned. Temperature was 60-65 F and humidity was 20-25%. Wind was from the east 3-10 mph. Most likely it was the combination of to much green plant material and not enough plant material was available to fuel the fire. The tilled micro-plot area on the north end of all the plots burned great. The micro-plots had lots of thick grass residue, foxtail, from the 2003 growing season which provided great fuel for the fire.

#  comment: "May 24, 2002 Dual II Magnum was applied preemergence to the corn on the main site treatment 3, all replications (6, 1, 3, 2, 4, and 5). Dual II Magnum (S-metolachlor (+ safener)) was applied at 1.33 pts/A, (1.56 L/ha). A total of 2.5 gals of Dual II Magnum were applied on 14 acres (5.67 hectares). Weather Conditions: Air temperature: 70 degrees F. Wind was out of the northwest at 0-8 mph, with an average of 5 mph. Relative Humidity: 45%. Time of application: between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. Equipment Used: JD 5220 tractor traveling 4.5 mph, gear B3 2000 rpm?s, with a pull type Top Air sprayer equipped with a PTO driven centrifugal sprayer pump and a Raven 440 automatic carrier control unit. Nozzles used: Turbo TeeJet 11003 spaced 15 inches apart with a total boom length of 30 feet. Application pressure: 12-14 psi. Carrier used: Water applied at 20 gals/A (187L/ha). Purpose of application: Control of annual grass weeds. This application was a broadcast preemergence herbicide, it was not banded. Most applications in treatment 3 have been banded however this application was broadcast. We did not have the equipment to apply this application in a band so to make sure that we had a preemgence herbicide applied to treatment 3 a broadcast application was made. "

In order to try and keep the standards of organic certification we ordered and planted untreated Pioneer 35Y54 seed corn. No fertilizer was applied at planting. Planting depth for the corn was 2-2.25 inches. The corn was planted in 30 inch rows. Corn was planted with the JD 7520 tractor and JD 1730 planter. The planter shaft on the JD 1730 planter broke after planting the west 1/3 of treatment 4 rep 4. There was a good chance of rain at KBS during the night so I finished planting treatment 4 rep 4 and 5 the the JD 7400 tractor and JD 7300 six row planter. "

#    Planted corn on the main site treatment 4, all relications, reps 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Planted Pioneer 35Y54 corn at 28,000 seeds/A (the monitor was reading 30,000 seeds/A). All the seed corn that was used for planting into trt 4 was untreated corn. In order to try and keep the standards of organic certification we ordered and planted untreated Pioneer 35Y54 seed corn. No fertilizer was applied at planting. Planting depth for the corn was 2-2.25 inches. The corn was planted in 30 inch rows. Corn was planted with the JD 7520 tractor and JD 1730 planter. The planter shaft on the JD 1730 planter broke after planting the west 1/3 of treatment 4 rep 4. There was a good chance of rain at KBS during the night so I finished planting treatment 4 rep 4 and 5 the the JD 7400 tractor and JD 7300 six row planter.

We used the JD 7420(a) tractor and JD 115 flail shredder. The decision to flail mow the rye was based on the height and stage of development of the rye. The majority of the rye was between 18-31 inches tall and had developed the seed head. At the time of flail mowing the rye had not pollinated and therefore did not have viable seeds. I was concerned that if we had just chisel plowed some of the rye could have still matured enough to produce viable seeds. We did not want are cover crop of rye to become a weed problem in the annual crops. Nicole was learning how to flail mow so she watched me mow treatment 3 rep 1, and treatment 4 rep 1.
