TODO: remove the destroy link from equipment, areas, etc. and replace it with an
archive button

TODO: add field number to area


TODO: add versioning
TODO: two classes of users one who can only edit their own records and some who can edit all records
TODO: irregular areas like the LYSIMETER field which does not have a treatment
      or replicates are currently handled by having an entry in the studies,
      treatment and areas table. I think they should just have an area entry
      and the Area.parse should search on area.name, but I don't know how to
      distinguish study names from irregular area names.
